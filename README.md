# Pattern-Matching-in-SQL

LIKE clause is used to perform the pattern matching task in SQL.

A WHERE clause is generally preceded by a LIKE clause in an SQL query.

LIKE clause searches for a match between the patterns in a query with the pattern in the values present in an SQL table. If the match is successful, then that particular value will be retrieved from the SQL table.

LIKE clause can work with strings and numbers.

The LIKE clause uses the following symbols known as wildcard operators in SQL to perform this pattern-matching task in SQL.

To represent zero, one or more than one character, % (percentage) is used.
To represent a single character _ (underscore) is used.
